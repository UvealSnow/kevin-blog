# My personal blog

I've built a couple of blogs for myself over the years.
This wouldn't be a problem, but every time I build one I end up forgetting about it in a couple of weeks

# This time it's different.

As my New Years' resolution I've decided to start an actual blog where I'll be writing about my interests, the skills that I pick up during the year, personal experiences and academic topics that interest me. There will be a minimum of 12 posts a year.
